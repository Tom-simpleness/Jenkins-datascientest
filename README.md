# DevOps Project - Multi-Environment Deployment Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project sets up a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline for a microservices application. The goal is to automatically deploy the application across multiple development environments using Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Helm.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── k8s/                  # Kubernetes manifests
├── microservices/        # Microservices source code
│   └── helm/             # Helm charts for deployment
├── Jenkinsfile           # Jenkins pipeline
└── README.md             # This file
```

## Technologies Used

- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for deployment
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package manager for deploying microservices
- **Docker**: Containerization of microservices

## Pipeline Features

1. Build and test microservices
2. Create and push Docker images
3. Deploy to different environments (dev, staging, prod) via Helm
4. Post-deployment integration tests
5. Environment promotion

## Prerequisites

- Operational Kubernetes cluster
- Jenkins installed and configured with required plugins
- Helm installed on Jenkins server and Kubernetes nodes
- Accessible Docker registry

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository on your Jenkins server.
2. Configure the required credentials in Jenkins (Docker registry, Kubernetes, etc.).
3. Create a new Jenkins pipeline pointing to the `Jenkinsfile` in this project.
4. Run the pipeline manually or configure webhooks for automatic triggers.

## Deployment

The pipeline automatically deploys the application to the following environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

Each environment is isolated in its own Kubernetes namespace.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Use Kubernetes-integrated tools for monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- Application logs are centralized using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Troubleshooting

If deployment issues occur:

1. Check Jenkins logs for specific errors
2. Use `kubectl` to inspect the state of pods and services in the Kubernetes cluster
3. View application logs using `kubectl logs`
